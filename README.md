# Tkinter-rgb-effect
This script creates a window with a button in the center. The button changes color every second,
following the order of the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).

When the button is created, the first color in the rainbow color list is assigned as the default color. Then, the change_color function is called every second and changes the button's color to the next color in the list. If the current color of the button is the last color in the list, the color is changed to the first color in the list.

This script illustrates how tkinter can be used to create a graphical user interface and change the appearance of an element in the interface.
